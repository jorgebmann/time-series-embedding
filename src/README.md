## Utils Directory
Supporting functions and utilities:

- Augmentation
- Helper functions for data processing
- Visualization tools
- Configuration management


## ðŸ“Š Evaluation Pipeline
The classification evaluation follows this pattern:
Time Series Data â†’ Embedding Method â†’ Feature Vector â†’ Classifier â†’ Results

- Load data using datasets/ utilities
- Apply embedding using methods from embeddings/
- Evaluate using classifiers from classifiers/
- Analyze results with tools from utils/
