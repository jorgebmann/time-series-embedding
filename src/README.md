# Scripts

The following Python files contain the embedding and classification methods as discussed in our paper.

For the embedding methods, the embd_fgit script is used. For the NNCLR method, the NNCLR_embd is used. This scrip also requires the augmentation and NNCLR script to be imported. 
As for the classification, two of the clasfy_p1 and clasfy_p2 should be imported.
