<p> Sleep contains 153 whole-night sleeping Electroencephalography
(EEG) recordings taken from physionet https://www.physionet.org/content/sleep-edfx/1.0.0/ and formatted into a classification problem in [1]. The data is collected
from 82 healthy subjects. The 1-lead EEG signal is sampled at 100 Hz.</p>

<p>The series were segmented into non overlapping sub series, each of which forms a case. Each case is labelled with one of the five sleeping patterns/stages: Wake (W), Nonrapid
eye movement (N1, N2, N3) and Rapid Eye Movement (REM). The classes are not balanced and there are differences in the class distribution for the train and test. Train/test proportions in brackets after name.</p>

<ol>
<li>Wake (13.84% in train and 4.05% in test)
<li>Non rapid eye movement type 1 (6.56% in train and 10.98% in test)
<li>Non rapid eye movement type 2 (42.73% in train and 48.93% in test)
<li>Non rapid eye movement type 3 (15.81% in train and 18.82% in test)
<li>Rapid Eye Movement (21.06% in train and 18.82% in test)
</ol>


The data were split in [1] into 371,055 train cases, 107,730 validation and 90,315 test. We have added the validation set to the end of the train file to ease reproduction if a validation set is needed. For reference, a MiniRocket classifier gets accuracy of 92.7% on the default test data.</p>
